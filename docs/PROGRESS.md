# Progress log

Append-only log of development sessions (newest at the bottom).

## 2026-11-11 — Project setup
- Wrote requirements, architecture, detailed design and ADRs 0001–0005.
- Created labels, milestones M0–M7 and 34 backlog issues (#1–#34).
- Added `AGENTS.md` (session procedure) and the Project board sync workflow.
- Next: #1 Project scaffolding.

## 2026-11-11 — #1 Project scaffolding
- Added `pyproject.toml` (hatchling backend, version read from `agentlens.__version__`,
  dev dependency group: ruff, mypy, pytest, pytest-cov, hypothesis, pre-commit) and `uv.lock`.
- `src/agentlens/__init__.py` with `__version__`, PEP 561 `py.typed` marker.
- Ruff lint/format config (markdown excluded: design docs hold pseudo-code), `mypy --strict`
  on `src/`, pytest with coverage gate 85% and a `live` marker skipped unless `AGENTLENS_LIVE_TESTS=1`.
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `.gitignore` (and untracked a stray `.pyc`), `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Made `.github/scripts/project_sync.py` ruff-clean (line length only, no behaviour change).
- Note: no PR CI exists yet (it arrives with #2); verified locally.
- Next: #2 CI workflow.
